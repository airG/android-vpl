# Android VPL
A VPL Helper library. A Virtual PreLoad (VPL) is a tiny APK that serves a single purpose: to launch the Play Store (or another app store) with your __actual__ app. This helps with preloading your app on devices as it takes much less space in the user's precious `/system` directory. 

Refer to the [Documentation](https://airg.github.io/android-vpl/) for details. 

# Usage
To use the _android-vpl_ library in your product, add the following line to your Gradle build script:

`compile 'com.airg.android:vpl:+@aar'`

Or download the library from the download link at the top of this page.
